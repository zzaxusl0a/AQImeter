# Aura

Aura is a simple weather widget that runs on ESP32-2432S028R ILI9341 devices with a 2.8" screen. These devices are sometimes called a "CYD" or Cheap Yellow Display.

This is just the source code for the project. This project includes a case design and assembly instructions. The complete instructions are available
